Purpose infuses our days with meaning, connects our actions to something larger than ourselves, and provides a compass for navigating life&#39;s complexities.</p><h2 id="beyond-the-misconceptions" tabindex="-1">Beyond the Misconceptions <a class="header-anchor" href="#beyond-the-misconceptions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Beyond the Misconceptions&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Many misconceptions surround the concept of purpose, creating unnecessary pressure and confusion. Let&#39;s dispel some of these myths:</p><ul><li><strong>Purpose is not necessarily a single, dramatic calling.</strong> For some, purpose manifests as multiple meaningful pursuits that evolve throughout life.</li><li><strong>Purpose doesn&#39;t always mean changing careers or making radical life changes.</strong> Often, it involves bringing new intention to existing roles and relationships.</li><li><strong>Purpose isn&#39;t something you discover once and permanently.</strong> Like other aspects of identity, it can evolve as you grow and your circumstances change.</li></ul><h2 id="the-elements-of-purpose" tabindex="-1">The Elements of Purpose <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-elements-of-purpose" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Elements of Purpose&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Purpose emerges at the intersection of several key elements:</p><h3 id="_1-your-natural-gifts-and-strengths" tabindex="-1">1.
